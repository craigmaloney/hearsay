  The programmer gives a slightly stern look. "Now, we didn't keep track of whether you selected Yourself, Alice, or Bob to look out the window. But that's OK. We can look at the p_values to make that determination. Most times you won't need to do this but this gives me a way to demonstrate multiple conditions based on multiple characters."

  The programmer beckons downward. "Here's your choice, sport."
