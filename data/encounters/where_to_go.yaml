  You arrive in a void that the programmer never intended you to go.

  It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

  Well, scratch the "likely" part. You hear grue-like chomping sounds all around you. Well, that's going to leave a mark.

  The programmer appears. "Aw nuts. Well, this is another fine mess. Third one this week. I'd best get a mop and the 409 cleaner."

  He motions toward your disembodied entity. "Look, it's not your fault you got here. These things happen. If you get a chance would you please let me know how you got here? I'd be much obliged."
