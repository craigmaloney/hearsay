  "It was a dark and stormy night", the programmer begins.

  You groan. "Seriously? You're starting with that old trope?", you say.

  "Hey, it worked for Snoopy. Look it up." The programmer clears his throat. "Anyway, this is a demonstration. It's not supposed to be a great story, only enough to get you started."

  You relax back into your seat and mumble something about sunk cost fallacies. "OK, I've made it this far. Show me what you've got."

  The programmer continues. "You, Alice, and Bob are stuck in a cabin..."

  "Bottle Episode" you interject.

  "Shut up. You're all stuck in a cabin. Your supplies are running low, and the fire is starting to burn out."

  "Suddenly Alice looks up. She thinks she saw something in the window."

  "What do you do?" the programmer says to you.
