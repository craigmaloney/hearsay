  You move toward the window. All you can see is darkness.

  Suddenly a hole opens up underneath Bob and Alice. They disappear into the void.

  Startled, you look around. You're all alone.

  Suddenly you hear a voice off-screen. "Cut! That's a wrap", the programmer says. The lights come up, and the crew begin dismantling the set.
 
  "Well done everyone", the programmer says. "There wasn't much to work with here, but I hope it gets some of the major ideas across. I think we... Bob! Get out of the catering truck! We have to pay for whatever they can't reuse. Go on, git!"

  The programmer looks to you. "That's the basic premise. Obviously this isn't a great story but I hope it shows you some of the power of this technology. You can learn more about Interactive Storytelling from Chris Crawford's site at https://erasmatazz.com."

  You look to the programmer.
