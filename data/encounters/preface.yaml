  This is a demonstration of some of the capabilities of the Hearsay engine. It is woefully incomplete, but hopefully will give you an example of how to use the system.

  The programmer remarks "Comments and patches welcome." You sense that is a pretty stock phrase for such an engine, but take the programmer at face value.
