# Hearsay Interactive Storytelling Engine

This is a storytelling engine for choice-based interactive storytelling. At some point I'll come up with a better description. That day has not yet materialized.

Documentation is forthcoming. Ideally this will have documentation that isn't the source-code itself nor will it live in my aging and addled mind. That day has not yet materialized.

This will also have other capabilities and features. That day has not... um, you get the idea.

The engine of this project is called "Hearsay", because it's based on the works of Chris Crawford's excellent "Storytron", "Wumpus" and "Le Morte D'Arthur" projects (as well as his essential books on Interactive Storytelling). It's called "Hearsay" because it's what I've heard / understood, and the telling of which might not be exact. If you want authenticity please see Chris' site "[Erasmatazz](https://erasmatazz.com)" for the source of truth.
